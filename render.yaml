# Redis is not available on free tier blueprint?
# Render supports Redis instances.
# If free tier doesn't support Redis, we might need to skip it or use a separate provider.
# For now, I'll include it, user can remove if needed.
# Note: Render Redis is not free. I will comment it out and use local cache or warn user.
# Actually, let's leave it out to ensure "free" deployment works, as Redis is paid on Render.
# I'll update the API to handle missing Redis if I were implementing caching, but for now I didn't implement Redis logic yet.
